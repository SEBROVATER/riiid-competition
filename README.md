# riiid-competition
My attempts to create a working project on my own from the beginning to the commit.
Data from the [Riiid! Answer Correctness Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction) was used.

The [riiid2.ipynb] (https://github.com/SEBROVATER/riiid-competition/blob/main/riiid2.ipynb) file was used as a much more simplified version of the 
[riiid.ipynb](https://github.com/SEBROVATER/riiid-competition/blob/main/riiid.ipynb) file for commit.
In the [riiid.ipynb](https://github.com/SEBROVATER/riiid-competition/blob/main/riiid.ipynb) I've got pretty good  AUC, but in commit it takes too much time because of competition's specific.
